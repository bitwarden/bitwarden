# Drawer

A drawer is a panel of supplmentary content that is adjacement to the page's main content.

<Primary />

<Controls />

## Usage

## Multiple Drawers

Only one drawer can be open at a time, and they do not stack. If a drawer is already open, opening
another will close and replace the one already open.

## Accessibility

- The the drawer primarily contains navigation links, the direct descendant of the drawer should be
  a [nav element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav); otherwise, use an
  [aside](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside).

```html
<bit-drawer>
  <aside>...</aside>
</bit-drawer>

<!-- or -->

<bit-drawer>
  <bit-drawer-body>
    <aside>...</aside>
  </bit-drawer-body>
</bit-drawer>
```

- The drawer should contain an h2 element. If you are using `bit-drawer-header`, this is created for
  you via the `title` input.

```html
<bit-drawer>
  <aside>
    <h2>Hello world!</h2>
  </aside>
</bit-drawer>
```
