# Custom ESLint rules

This package contains custom ESLint rules for JavaScript and TypeScript.

When this repository has transitioned to ESLint flat configuration files we should consider moving the rules to team-specific folders
and referencing them directly from the `eslint.config.js` files instead of installing them as a package.
